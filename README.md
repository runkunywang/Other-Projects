## Robotic Surgery on Locusts
This project consisted of a robotic manipulator able to insert an electrode into a brain of a locust insect. The poster of the project can be found in the file listed below.

## NASA Artemis Proposal
This project is my senior design project. It modeled the decent and landing systems, power systems, and communication systems of a lunar lander. More about this project can be found [here](https://sites.wustl.edu/artemisproposal/).

## Laundry Queue and Alert System
This project created a device that was able to attach onto any laundry machine. A phone number was associated with the device where you could text to check the status of the laundry machine or to be put in line for the use of the machine. More about this project can be found [here](https://classes.engineering.wustl.edu/ese205/core/index.php?title=Laundry_Alert_Page).
